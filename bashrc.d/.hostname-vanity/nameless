  King of Qin: I have just come to a realization! This scroll by Broken Sword
  contains no secrets of his swordsmanship. What this reveals is his highest
  ideal. In the first state, man and sword become one and each other. Here,
  even a blade of grass can be used as a lethal weapon. In the next stage, the
  sword resides not in the hand but in the heart. Even without a weapon, the
  warrior can slay his enemy from a hundred paces. But the ultimate ideal is
  when the sword disappears altogether. The warrior embraces all around him.
  The desire to kill no longer exists. Only peace remains.
