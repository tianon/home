  King of Qin:

  I have just come to a realization! This scroll by Broken Sword contains no
  secrets of his swordsmanship. What this reveals is his highest ideal.

  In the first state, man and sword become one and each other. Here, even a
  blade of grass can be used as a lethal weapon.

  In the next stage, the sword resides not in the hand but in the heart. Even
  without a weapon, the warrior can slay his enemy from a hundred paces.

  But the ultimate ideal is when the sword disappears altogether. The warrior
  embraces all around him.

  The desire to kill no longer exists. Only peace remains.
