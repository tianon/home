  Pity, Montag, pity. Don't haggle and nag them; you were so recently one of
  them yourself. They are so confident that they will run on for ever. But
  they won't run on. They don't know that this is all one huge big blazing
  meteor that makes a pretty fire in space, but that some day it'll have to
  hit. They see only the blaze, the pretty fire, as you saw it.
