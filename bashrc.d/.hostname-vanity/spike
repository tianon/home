  "We like to talk big, vampires do.
  'I'm going to destroy the world.'
  That's just tough-guy talk.
  Strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood.
  The truth is, I like this world.
  You've got... dog racing, Manchester united.
  And you've got people.
  Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs.
  It's all right here.
  
  But then someone comes along with a vision.
  With a real... passion for destruction.
  Angel could pull it off.
  Good-bye, Piccadilly. Farewell, Leicester-bloody-Square."
